### Representation Learning
 * We used a large dataset of Molecule.one heuristic to make a training set for MPNN
    * combination of binary loss / linear regression
 * We decided to oversample training examples with good energies
    * we created an extrapolation heuristic to know how well we could do on arbitrarily large subset
 
 * Action space
    * Building blocks
    * We could also try 
 
 * TPNN
 
 * Agent Representation
    * Molecule Graph seems to give improvements 
 
 * It seems like overfitting is a central issue to MPNN an on 2K examples we could explain 1/2 of variance
 
 * It seems likely
