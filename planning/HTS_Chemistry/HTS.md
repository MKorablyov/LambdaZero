### Enzymes
Drugs/natural products measure gaussian
We could expand specificity as well as space of reactions with enzymes

Add quickly designable with simple reactions molecules
Build a super large Boltzmann search for this (Boltzmann action space could be sampling from all molecules). 
We could also do Boltzmann-EI
This should be quite easy actually to run retrosynthesize with templates based on Chenghao's reactions
(because there are only a few reactions - we should either see our known reagents?) 
We could retrobuild building blocks space from a very large set of decomposition of
Randomly sampled good QED 2-reactions molecules
