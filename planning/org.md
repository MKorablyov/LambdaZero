WANDB reports
build github repo docs
centralize objectives

Maybe, every collaborator could have a MILA-X guest channel
I need to meet in person with both advisors and with each of students regularly
Summary of major ideas
Make a schedule before every RL/ bayesian meeting
I think we could standartise meetings IE: 3 minute presentations; 20 minute presentations

HTS reactions/ process should be patented

Make a video about the project
Apply for a large grant for many years (maybe several grants)
Declare startup to MILA

Incorporate
Apply for OPT and later for EB1 US


We could make a MILA drug discovery day and invite all collaborators
