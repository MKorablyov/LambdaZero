  abstract = "Accurate and reliable calculation of protein-ligand binding free
              energy is of central importance in computational biophysics and
              structure-based drug design. Among the various methods to
              calculate protein-ligand binding affinities, alchemical free
              energy perturbation (FEP) calculations performed by way of
              explicitly solvated molecular dynamics simulations (FEP/MD)
              provide a thermodynamically rigorous and complete description of
              the binding event and should in turn yield highly accurate
              predictions. Although the original theory of FEP was proposed
              more than 60 years ago, subsequent applications of FEP to compute
              protein-ligand binding free energies in the context of drug
              discovery projects over much of that time period was sporadic and
              generally unsuccessful. This was mainly due to the limited
              accuracy of the available force fields, inadequate sampling of
              the protein-ligand conformational space, complexity of simulation
              set up and analysis, and the large computational resources
              required to pursue such calculations. Over the past few years,
              there have been advances in computing power, classical force
              field accuracy, enhanced sampling algorithms, and simulation
              setup. This has led to newer FEP implementations such as the FEP+
              technology developed by Schr{\"o}dinger Inc., which has enabled
              accurate and reliable calculations of protein-ligand binding free
              energies and positioned free energy calculations to play a
              guiding role in small-molecule drug discovery. In this chapter,
              we outline the methodological advances in FEP+, including the
              OPLS3 force fields, the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute
              Tempering) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling
              with conventional FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through
              FEP/REST, and the advanced simulation setup and data analysis.
              The validation of FEP+ method in retrospective studies and the
              prospective applications in drug discovery projects are also
              discussed. We then present the recent extension of FEP+ method to
              handle challenging perturbations, including core-hopping
              transformations, macrocycle modifications, and reversible
              covalent inhibitor optimization. The limitations and pitfalls of
              the current FEP+ methodology and the best practices in real
              applications are also examined.",

  abstract = 	 {Chemical space is so large that brute force searches for new interesting molecules are infeasible. High-throughput virtual screening via computer cluster simulations can speed up the discovery process by collecting very large amounts of data in parallel, e.g., up to hundreds or thousands of parallel measurements. Bayesian optimization (BO) can produce additional acceleration by sequentially identifying the most useful simulations or experiments to be performed next. However, current BO methods cannot scale to the large numbers of parallel measurements and the massive libraries of molecules currently used in high-throughput screening. Here, we propose a scalable solution based on a parallel and distributed implementation of Thompson sampling (PDTS). We show that, in small scale problems, PDTS performs similarly as parallel expected improvement (EI), a batch version of the most widely used BO heuristic. Additionally, in settings where parallel EI does not scale, PDTS outperforms other scalable baselines such as a greedy search, $\epsilon$-greedy approaches and a random search method. These results show that PDTS is a successful solution for large-scale parallel BO.}

  abstract = 	 {How can we efficiently gather information to optimize an unknown function, when presented with multiple, mutually dependent information sources with different costs? For example, when optimizing a physical system, intelligently trading off computer simulations and real-world tests can lead to significant savings. Existing multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization methods, such as multi-fidelity GP-UCB or Entropy Search-based approaches, either make simplistic assumptions on the interaction among different fidelities or use simple heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we study multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization with complex structural dependencies among multiple outputs, and propose MF-MI-Greedy, a principled algorithmic framework for addressing this problem. In particular, we model different fidelities using additive Gaussian processes based on shared latent relationships with the target function. Then we use cost-sensitive mutual information gain for efficient Bayesian optimization. We propose a simple notion of regret which incorporates the varying cost of different fidelities, and prove that MF-MI-Greedy achieves low regret. We demonstrate the strong empirical performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real-world datasets.}
