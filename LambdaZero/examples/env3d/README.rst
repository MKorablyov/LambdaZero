Generating  molecules in 3D
===========================

This sub-package implements experiments to predict the next block and its
attachment angle, given a parent molecule and the attachment point.

The long term goal of this work is to give the reinforcement agent control over
space geometry through the attachment angle. This work validates that it is
possible to learn (next block, angle).

Modules
------------

- `geometry.py`

  Functions to compute molecular moments of inertia and rotate molecules
  in 3D space.


- `rdkit_utilities.py`

  Convenience functions that wrap together various RDKIT functionalities
  to achieve specific goals.

- `utilities.py`

  Ancillary code to perform useful generic things.

- `SE3*.py`

  Initial brainstorming code from Maksym. Not currently used.



Sub-folders
------------

- **convergence_analysis**:

  The code in this package investigates the convergence properties of RDKIT with
  respect to the number of configurations are embedded and then optimized.

- **sanity_checks**:

  Various scripts to test assumptions about RDKIT.


- **dataset**:

  Code to generate a dataset of (parent molecules, [lowest energy child block, child angle]), where the
  parent molecule is generated by a random walk and the child molecule (ie, parent + one block)
  is embedded and relaxed with rdkit.

- **tests**:

  Unit tests.
