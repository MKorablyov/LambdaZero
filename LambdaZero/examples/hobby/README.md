### Efficient implementation of RL and active learning

I want to be able to:
*share bottom weights including with agent
*have any model of uncertainty such as BRR/evidential/etc/docking and any acquisition function
*I want to be able to run the same acquisition function on a static dataset
*I want to run BRR in online (just choose a small update interval should be fine)
