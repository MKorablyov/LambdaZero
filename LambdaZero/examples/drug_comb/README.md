# Summary
This directory holds the code for predicting synergistic drug combinations.  The code revolves around the DrugComb 
database (https://drugcomb.fimm.fi/, https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W43/5486743), as well as various
predictive models, most centered around MPNNs.  The code is organized into three separate main directories, while
the entry point for the code coming in `train.py`.  In the following, we will first summarize how to run the code,
and subsequently the structure of the codebase.
